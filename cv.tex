\section*{Education}
\begin{longtable}{L!{\VRule}R}
2008 -- 2011 & MSc in Computer Science, University of Florence, 110/110 cum laude.\\[5pt]
    & Thesis, supervised by Prof. Luigi Brugnano:
	\begin{center}``\textsc{Efficient methods for the numerical solution of Hamiltonian problems}''\end{center}
	Analysis of the effectiveness of numerical methods for differential equations with respect to the preservation
	of qualitative properties of the simulated system, with particular attention to energy conservation in the case
	of Hamiltonian systems and to the efficient implementation of such techniques, using a framework developed \emph{ad hoc}
	with the \clang\ language.\\[5pt]
2004 -- 2008 & BSc in Computer Science, University of Florence, 110/110.\\[5pt]
    & Thesis, supervised by Prof. Luigi Brugnano:
    \begin{center}``\textsc{Numerical methods in Linear Algebra with applications to Google's Pagerank}''\end{center}
	Study of the \emph{random surfer} model and possible approaches to the calculation of the stationary point of the Markov
	chain associated with it, with the aim of combining modeling and mathematical aspects of the problem with those of its efficient
	resolution on a computer. The approaches and algorithms presented were compared on the basis of experimental results obtained
	with \matlab\ implementations.
