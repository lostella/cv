Proximal Operators.jl		& \lang{Julia}\ package to compute the proximal operator of several functions commonly used in optimization. The purpose is to have a toolbox of efficiently implemented operators, to be used as building blocks for large scale, nonsmooth optimization algorithms such as (fast) proximal gradient methods, ADMM, and primal-dual splitting algorithms. \spacednewline

ForBES		& \lang{Matlab}\ framework to develop solvers for nonsmooth optimization, contains a library of mathematical functions to formulate problems arising in control, machine learning, image and signal processing.
Contains novel, efficient, Newton-type algorithms for nonsmooth problems based on my PhD research. \spacednewline
