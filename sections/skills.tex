\begin{cvsection}{Programming skills}
\lang{Matlab} & I worked with \lang{Matlab} since my BSc and used it on a daily basis during my PhD to implement \href{https://kul-forbes.github.io/ForBES}{\mylink{optimization algorithms}} and perform numerical simulations.\spacednewline
\lang{Julia} & I worked with \lang{Julia} since Summer 2016 and used it ever since. I \href{https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl}{\mylink{contribute}} to the package ecosystem, and intend to keep working with \lang{Julia} as I generally prefer it over \lang{Matlab}.\spacednewline
\lang{Python} & I am proficient with the language, although it rarely was the main tool in my workflow. I am particularly interested in working with modern numerical and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano.\spacednewline
\lang{C} & I am fully proficient with the language and often use it to implement efficient routines when this is not possible with high-level languages, like \href{https://github.com/lostella/libLBFGS}{\mylink{in this case}}.\spacednewline
